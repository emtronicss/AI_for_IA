## Technical Requisites Checklist

### General Requirements
- [ ] **Python Installation**
  - Ensure Python is installed (Version 3.7 or above recommended).
  - Use package management tools like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for environment management.

- [ ] **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
  - Use IDEs such as:
    - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

### Libraries and Frameworks
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing Libraries**
  - Install libraries for AI agent functionality:
    - `transformers` from Hugging Face
    - `spaCy` for advanced NLP processing
    - `NLTK` for basic language processing functions

- [ ] **Web Frameworks (Optional)**
  - For deployment of AI agents, consider these frameworks:
    - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
    - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

### Code Resources
- [ ] **GitHub Repository**
  - Access the GitHub repository containing code samples from the tutorial.
  - Clone the repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

### Implementation Platforms
- [ ] **Google Colab**
  - Ideal for running Python code in a cloud-based environment.
  - Offers pre-installed libraries and easy sharing options.
  - [Get Started with Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

- [ ] **Local Machine Setup**
  - A local setup provides complete control over the environment and dependencies.
  - Ensure all dependencies are listed and install using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- [ ] **Cloud Platforms**
  - Consider using cloud computing services for scalable implementations:
    - [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
    - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
    - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
