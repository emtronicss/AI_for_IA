In this notebook I replicate the work in this article posted in medium:
https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ai-agents-from-concepts-to-practical-implementation-in-python-fb26789b1560

In the article the author briefly introduces AI agents or LLMs (Large Language Models). He points out that a more robust system with better results can be obtained if instead of prompting a single LLM to handle a complex task, the task is split between multiple agents, each one specialized in a specific related area. 
The task consists in implementing a content creation workflow system that writes blog posts, LinkedIn content and Twitter posts, after extensive research about a topic selected by the user, which in this case is about analyzing the content of a video created by the author himself.

Again, to execute just start from the top of the notebook and if an error is trown about libraries version, restart the runtime.
